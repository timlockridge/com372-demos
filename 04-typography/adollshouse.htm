               <h3>ACT I</h3>

                    <p>(SCENE.--A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
                    extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the
                    entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer's study. Between the
                    doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door, and
                    beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs and
                    a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another door;
                    and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy chairs
                    and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small table.
                    Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small objects;
                    a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are carpeted, and a
                    fire burns in the stove. It is winter.</p>

                    <p>A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to open.
                    Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor dress
                    and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to the
                    right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is seen
                    a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he gives
                    to the MAID who has opened the door.)</p>

                    <p>Nora. Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children
                    do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed. (To the PORTER,
                    taking out her purse.) How much?</p>

                    <p>Porter. Sixpence.</p>

                    <p>Nora. There is a shilling. No, keep the change. (The PORTER thanks her,
                    and goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she
                    takes off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her
                    pocket and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door
                    and listens.) Yes, he is in. (Still humming, she goes to the table on
                    the right.)</p>

                    <p>Helmer (calls out from his room). Is that my little lark twittering out
                    there?</p>

                    <p>Nora (busy opening some of the parcels). Yes, it is!</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>

                    <p>Nora. Yes!</p>

                    <p>Helmer. When did my squirrel come home?</p>

                    <p>Nora. Just now. (Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
                    mouth.) Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Don't disturb me. (A little later, he opens the door and looks
                    into the room, pen in hand.) Bought, did you say? All these things? Has
                    my little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p>

                    <p>Nora. Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go
                    a little. This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to
                    economise.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly. Nora. Yes,
                    Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn't we? Just a tiny
                    wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots of
                    money.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter
                    before the salary is due.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Pooh! we can borrow until then.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Nora! (Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.) The
                    same little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds
                    today, and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New
                    Year's Eve a slate fell on my head and killed me, and--Nora (putting her
                    hands over his mouth). Oh! don't say such horrid things.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Still, suppose that happened,--what then?</p>

                    <p>Nora. If that were to happen, I don't suppose I should care whether I
                    owed money or not.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?</p>

                    <p>Nora. They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they
                    were.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think
                    about that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty
                    about a home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept
                    bravely on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way for
                    the short time longer that there need be any struggle.</p>

                    <p>Nora (moving towards the stove). As you please, Torvald.</p>

                    <p>Helmer (following her). Come, come, my little skylark must not droop her
                    wings. What is this! Is my little squirrel out of temper? (Taking out
                    his purse.) Nora, what do you think I have got here?</p>

                    <p>Nora (turning round quickly). Money!</p>

                    <p>Helmer. There you are. (Gives her some money.) Do you think I don't know
                    what a lot is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas-time?</p>

                    <p>Nora (counting). Ten shillings--a pound--two pounds! Thank you, thank
                    you, Torvald; that will keep me going for a long time.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Indeed it must.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Yes, yes, it will. But come here and let me show you what I have
                    bought. And all so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Ivar, and
                    a sword; and a horse and a trumpet for Bob; and a doll and dolly's
                    bedstead for Emmy,--they are very plain, but anyway she will soon break
                    them in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs for the
                    maids; old Anne ought really to have something better.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. And what is in this parcel?</p>

                    <p>Nora (crying out). No, no! you mustn't see that until this evening.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Very well. But now tell me, you extravagant little person, what
                    would you like for yourself?</p>

                    <p>Nora. For myself? Oh, I am sure I don't want anything.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Yes, but you must. Tell me something reasonable that you would
                    particularly like to have.</p>

                    <p>Nora. No, I really can't think of anything--unless, Torvald--</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Well?</p>

                    <p>Nora (playing with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to
                    his). If you really want to give me something, you might--you might--</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Well, out with it!</p>

                    <p>Nora (speaking quickly). You might give me money, Torvald. Only just as
                    much as you can afford; and then one of these days I will buy something
                    with it.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. But, Nora--</p>

                    <p>Nora. Oh, do! dear Torvald; please, please do! Then I will wrap it up in
                    beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the Christmas Tree. Wouldn't that be
                    fun?</p>

                    <p>Helmer. What are little people called that are always wasting money?</p>

                    <p>Nora. Spendthrifts--I know. Let us do as you suggest, Torvald, and then
                    I shall have time to think what I am most in want of. That is a very
                    sensible plan, isn't it?</p>

                    <p>Helmer (smiling). Indeed it is--that is to say, if you were really to
                    save out of the money I give you, and then really buy something for
                    yourself. But if you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number of
                    unnecessary things, then I merely have to pay up again.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Oh but, Torvald--</p>

                    <p>Helmer. You can't deny it, my dear little Nora. (Puts his arm round
                    her waist.) It's a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a deal of
                    money. One would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are!</p>

                    <p>Nora. It's a shame to say that. I do really save all I can.</p>

                    <p>Helmer (laughing). That's very true,--all you can. But you can't save
                    anything!</p>

                    <p>Nora (smiling quietly and happily). You haven't any idea how many
                    expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always
                    find some new way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you
                    have got it, it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it
                    has gone. Still, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for
                    indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Ah, I wish I had inherited many of papa's qualities.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. And I would not wish you to be anything but just what you are,
                    my sweet little skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you are
                    looking rather--what shall I say--rather uneasy today?</p>

                    <p>Nora. Do I?</p>

                    <p>Helmer. You do, really. Look straight at me.</p>

                    <p>Nora (looks at him). Well?</p>

                    <p>Helmer (wagging his finger at her). Hasn't Miss Sweet Tooth been
                    breaking rules in town today?</p>

                    <p>Nora. No; what makes you think that?</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Hasn't she paid a visit to the confectioner's?</p>

                    <p>Nora. No, I assure you, Torvald--</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Not been nibbling sweets?</p>

                    <p>Nora. No, certainly not.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Not even taken a bite at a macaroon or two?</p>

                    <p>Nora. No, Torvald, I assure you really--</p>

                    <p>Helmer. There, there, of course I was only joking.</p>

                    <p>Nora (going to the table on the right). I should not think of going
                    against your wishes.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. No, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your word-- (Going
                    up to her.) Keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, my darling.
                    They will all be revealed tonight when the Christmas Tree is lit, no
                    doubt.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Did you remember to invite Doctor Rank?</p>

                    <p>Helmer. No. But there is no need; as a matter of course he will come to
                    dinner with us. However, I will ask him when he comes in this morning.
                    I have ordered some good wine. Nora, you can't think how I am looking
                    forward to this evening.</p>

                    <p>Nora. So am I! And how the children will enjoy themselves, Torvald!</p>

                    <p>Helmer. It is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe
                    appointment, and a big enough income. It's delightful to think of, isn't
                    it?</p>

                    <p>Nora. It's wonderful!</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Do you remember last Christmas? For a full three weeks
                    beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight,
                    making ornaments for the Christmas Tree, and all the other fine things
                    that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest three weeks I ever
                    spent!</p>

                    <p>Nora. I didn't find it dull.</p>

                    <p>Helmer (smiling). But there was precious little result, Nora.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Oh, you shouldn't tease me about that again. How could I help the
                    cat's going in and tearing everything to pieces?</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Of course you couldn't, poor little girl. You had the best of
                    intentions to please us all, and that's the main thing. But it is a good
                    thing that our hard times are over.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Yes, it is really wonderful.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. This time I needn't sit here and be dull all alone, and you
                    needn't ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands--</p>

                    <p>Nora (clapping her hands). No, Torvald, I needn't any longer, need I!
                    It's wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! (Taking his arm.) Now I will
                    tell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrange things, Torvald.
                    As soon as Christmas is over--(A bell rings in the hall.) There's the
                    bell. (She tidies the room a little.) There's some one at the door. What
                    a nuisance!</p>

                    <p>Helmer. If it is a caller, remember I am not at home.</p>

                    <p>Maid (in the doorway). A lady to see you, ma'am,--a stranger.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Ask her to come in.</p>

                    <p>Maid (to HELMER). The doctor came at the same time, sir.</p>

                    <p>Helmer. Did he go straight into my room?</p>

                    <p>Maid. Yes, sir.</p>

                    <p>(HELMER goes into his room. The MAID ushers in Mrs. LINDE, who is in
                    travelling dress, and shuts the door.) Mrs. Linde (in a dejected and
                    timid voice). How do you do, Nora?</p>

                    <p>Nora (doubtfully). How do you do--Mrs. Linde. You don't recognise me, I
                    suppose.</p>

                    <p>Nora. No, I don't know--yes, to be sure, I seem to--(Suddenly.) Yes!
                    Christine! Is it really you?</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Linde. Yes, it is I.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Christine! To think of my not recognising you! And yet how could
                    I--(In a gentle voice.) How you have altered, Christine!</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Linde. Yes, I have indeed. In nine, ten long years--</p>

                    <p>Nora. Is it so long since we met? I suppose it is. The last eight years
                    have been a happy time for me, I can tell you. And so now you have come
                    into the town, and have taken this long journey in winter--that was
                    plucky of you.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Linde. I arrived by steamer this morning.</p>

                    <p>Nora. To have some fun at Christmas-time, of course. How delightful! We
                    will have such fun together! But take off your things. You are not cold,
                    I hope. (Helps her.) Now we will sit down by the stove, and be cosy.
                    No, take this armchair; I will sit here in the rocking-chair. (Takes
                    her hands.) Now you look like your old self again; it was only the first
                    moment--You are a little paler, Christine, and perhaps a little thinner.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Linde. And much, much older, Nora.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Perhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much.
                    (Stops suddenly and speaks seriously.) What a thoughtless creature I am,
                    chattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Linde. What do you mean, Nora?</p>

                    <p>Nora (gently). Poor Christine, you are a widow.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Linde. Yes; it is three years ago now.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I
                    meant ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off
                    and something always prevented me.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Linde. I quite understand, dear.</p>

                    <p>Nora. It was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must have
                    suffered. And he left you nothing?</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Linde. No.</p>

                    <p>Nora. And no children?</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Linde. No.</p>

                    <p>Nora. Nothing at all, then.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Linde. Not even any sorrow or grief to live upon.</p>
